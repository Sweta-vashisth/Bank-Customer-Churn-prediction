# Customer churn prediction

# Problem Statement 
Customer churn or customer attrition is a tendency of clients or customers to abandon a brand and stop being a paying client of a particular business or organization. The percentage of customers that discontinue using a company’s services or products during a specific period is called a customer churn rate. Several bad experiences (or just one) are enough, and a customer may quit. And if a large chunk of unsatisfied customers churn at a time interval, both material losses and damage to reputation would be enormous.

A reputed bank “ABC BANK” wants to predict the Churn rate. Create a model by using different machine learning approaches that can predict the best result.
